# Yaarn Agency Guide

Welcome to Yaarn, your all-in-one PR platform for tracking news and coverage, managing clients and servicing, and generating engaging content.

Here are some tips to help you use this software. For help, email [contact@yaarn.ai](mailto:contact@yaarn.ai) and we'll be in touch faster than you can say 'print deadline'.

## Logging into your Yaarn account

1. Head to [https://login.yaarn.ai/email](https://login.yaarn.ai/email)
2. Select your workspace
3. Confirm your email and get your login link (check your spam folder)
4. Click the link in your email and you're in!

## Adding new users to your workspace

1. In the sidebar, click the Settings tab → Users
2. Click Invite User. Then, enter their name and email and choose whether you'd like them to be a standard user (Agency) or have access to restricted controls and settings (Admin). Click Submit and your new user is created.
3. The new user will receive an invitation link in their email inbox.

_Tip: If they didn't receive the invitation or the link has expired, you can click Resend Invite._

Once a user has been added, click Edit and assign them clients from the dropdown list.

_Tip: If their client doesn't exist, you'll need to create a new client. You can assign team members to clients on the client creation page._

4. To permanently delete a user click the Delete button. To archive a user without permanently deleting them, click the Archived checkbox.
5. If you'd like to further restrict permissions for standard Agency users, click the Advanced Options button → Agency text and check or uncheck the permissions.
