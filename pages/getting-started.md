# Getting Started with Yaarn

Welcome! We appreciate your interest in Yaarn. The following guide will help you hit the grounds running with our PRM tool.

## Step 1: Create workspace

To begin, please go to [login.yaarn.ai](https://login.yaarn.ai) using your preferred web browser. Click on "Sign Up" to create a new workspace and account. Follow the steps to set your workspace up.

### Workspace name

The workspace name is the name of your PR agency or company. This will be used as the subdomain for your workspace. For example, if you input "My Workspace" as your workspace name, your workspace URL will be "my-workspace.yaarn.ai".

### Profile

The profile is the name of the user who will be the primary administrator of the workspace. This is the person who will be responsible for managing the workspace and its users. Email addresses are unique across all workspaces, so if you are creating a new workspace, you will need to use a different email address from the one you used to sign up for another workspace.

### Invite your team

At the heart of every PR agency are the strategists and managers. On Yaarn, you are provided with a user-friendly interface to add and manage team members.

To do this, simply click "Add your first team member". Input their name and email address, designate their role (e.g., agency manager or client), and an invitation email will be sent to them.

They simply have to accept the invite and set up their profile, and voila - they are now active members of your workspace!

### Add clients

Once you have added your team members, you can now add your clients. To do this, click "Add your first client". You can use this to invite users from the client side as well, so that they're able to view their own activities and coverage.

If you have further questions, please look into our [FAQs](https://docs.yaarn.ai/faqs) or feel free to reach out to our friendly support team at [contact@yaarn.ai](mailto:contact@yaarn.ai). We are here to help you get started and ensure your user experience of Yaarn is as smooth as possible. Enjoy Yaarn and welcome aboard!
