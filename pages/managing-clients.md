# Managing Clients with Yaarn

Managing your clients efficiently is easy with Yaarn. Here, we'll guide you through how to add new clients and edit existing ones on our platform.

## Adding a New Client

1. Navigate to _Settings > Clients > Create Client_.

2. You'll be taken to a setup wizard with five stages. In the **first step**, you'll need to enter the following details:

   - **Client’s name**: This identifies the client in your workspace.

   - **Tags**: These tags are essential for tagging news wrap items.

   - **Address**: The main location of the client's business.

   - **Boilerplate**: A brief description of the client's company, product, or service. This is important as our built-in AI relies on this context to function properly.

   - **Service Scope**: Describe the range of services that your agency is offering to the client.

3. In the **second step**, you'll have to upload your client's logo. This is important as it will appear in client profiles.

4. For the **third step**, input your client’s spokespeople. Information such as their name, title, and biography will be required. You can add multiple spokespeople by clicking on the 'Add Spokesperson' button.

5. During the **fourth step**, you'll add the client's employees to the database.

6. Finally, in the **fifth step**, assign agency managers to the client. Select managers from the dropdown list of your team's agency managers.

And that's it! Your newly added client should now appear in the 'Clients' page.

Remember, you can always edit these details later if necessary. To do so, simply navigate back to _Settings > Clients_, and click on the 'Edit' button next to the relevant client.

# Hiding Analysis from Clients

You may want to hide the sentiment analysis and competitor analysis from certain or all clients. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to do this.

## Hiding Analysis for All Clients

1. Please navigate to _Settings_ -> _Users_ -> _Advanced Options_ -> _Roles_.

2. Here, click on the _Client role_ to modify its permissions.

3. Untick the boxes for _"Can view competitor analysis"_ and _"Can view client sentiment"_.

By doing this, you will deactivate the visibility of these features for all users under the client role.

## Hiding Analysis for Specific Clients

If you want to hide these analyses only from specific clients, you will need to create a new role.

1. From the _Roles_ page, click on _"Add Role"_.

2. Give your new role a name and assign the desired permissions, ensuring that _"Can view competitor analysis"_ and _"Can view client sentiment"_ remain unticked.

3. Go back to the _Users_ page found under _Settings_ from the left-hand navigation bar.

4. Click on _'Edit'_ for each user that you want to assign the new role to, then select the new role from the dropdown menu.

And you're set! These clients will not have access to sentiment or competitor analyses. Of course, these settings can always be adjusted later if needed.
