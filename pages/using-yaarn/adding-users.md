Your new user will receive an email with a link to set up their account.

_Tip: If they didn’t receive the invitation or the link has expired, you can click Resend Invite._

Once a user has been added, click Edit and assign them clients from the dropdown list.

_Tip: If their client doesnt exist, you’ll need to create a new client. You can assign team members to clients on the client creation page._

If you’d like to further restrict permissions for standard Agency users, click the Advanced Options button → Agency text and check or uncheck the permissions.
